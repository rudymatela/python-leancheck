TODO for leancheck.py
=====================

* try to infer argument types from `__init__` or `__new__`

* fix infinite loop in `print(Enumerator(set[bool]))`

* simplify code

* Add some built-in benchmarks.
  Performance is not so good currently.

* add carry-on flag

* package _all_ files like in Haskell's leancheck
