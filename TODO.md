TODO for leancheck.py
=====================

* count actual tests from "vacuous truth" tests
  using the precondition mechanism

* fix infinite loop in `print(Enumerator[set[bool]])`

* simplify code

* Add some built-in benchmarks.
  Performance is not so good currently.

* add carry-on flag

* package _all_ files like in Haskell's leancheck
