TODO for leancheck.py
=====================

* add Enumerator for set

* add Enumerator for dict

* Add `precondition()` function:
  it raises a PreconditionException which is interpreted by `check` as `True`!
  It should make properties idiomatic.

* simplify code

* create iitertools module?

* Add some built-in benchmarks.
  Performance is not so good currently.
